# Links and buttons

Links are pretty straightforward. For instance, you might link to [the Electric Book template](https://ebw.co/template){:.show-url}.

Buttons should be defined by adding a `.button` class to any element, such as a link. The template allows for [inline buttons](http://example.com){:.button} and block-level buttons:

[Example](http://example.com) {:.button}
