# Code

[See the docs](https://github.com/UR-DataScience/electric-book/tree/2a308e4940331c0bffb0ddf1cef032daccf6dc4f/samples/text/%7B%7B%20site.canonical-url%20%7D%7D/docs/editing/markdown.html#code) on writing code in markdown.

Trust the geeks, they've got this sorted. Here's a code block from [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/221/).

```javascript
int random()
{
     return 5; // Chosen by dice roll, guaranteed to be random
}
```

What about two consecutive clode blocks? Here's some YAML book metadata from this project, followed by some [funny code from StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/766363/1781075).

```yaml
project:
  # The name of the organisation or entity that owns this project
  organisation: "Electric Book Works"
  # A live web address for the organisation
  url: "https://electricbookworks.com/"
  # The name of the project of books in this folder.
  name: "The Electric Book workflow"
```

```php
// Replaces with spaces the braces in cases where braces in places cause stasis 
   $str = str_replace(array("\{","\}")," ",$str);
```
